This is an [KSDK](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-ksdk)-based kernel that solely
runs unit tests. It is shipped with [KSDK](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-ksdk)
to provide default unit-test infrastructure for kernel projects based on
[KSTD](https://crates.io/crates/kstd).

This is part of the [Astros](https://github.com/astros/astros)
